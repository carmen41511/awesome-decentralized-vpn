- [**Helium**](https://www.helium.com/): The world's first peer to peer wireless network [[github](https://github.com/helium)] 
- [**VPN3.io**](https://www.hotspotvpn.io/): AI-Powered Decentralized VPN3

## Open Source Projects
- [**cjdns**](https://gathman.org/meshdoc/Cjdns%20-%20Wikipedia.html): An encrypted IPv6 network using public-key cryptography for address allocation and a distributed hash table for routing.[[github](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns)] 
- [**OpenVPN**](https://openvpn.net/): OpenVPN is an open source VPN daemon.[[github](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn)]
- [**Orbot**](https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.torproject.android/): Orbot is a free proxy app that provides anonymity on the Internet for users of the Android and iOS operating systems. which could form the basis for a decentralized VPN. [[github](https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot)]
- [**ZeroTier**](https://www.zerotier.com/): Directly Connecting the World's Devices with Universal Software Defined Networking [[github](https://github.com/zerotier)]
- [**GNUnet**](https://www.gnunet.org/en/): GNUnet is a software framework for decentralized, peer-to-peer networking and an official GNU package. [[github]https://git.gnunet.org/gnunet.git/)]
- [**RetroShare**](https://retroshare.cc/): Retroshare is a free and open-source peer-to-peer communication and file sharing app based on a friend-to-friend network built by GNU Privacy Guard. [[github](https://github.com/RetroShare)]

## Peer-to-peer networking libraries
- [**LibTorrent**](https://www.libtorrent.org/) - A peer-to-peer networking library for implementing the BitTorrent protocol. While mainly used for file sharing, the underlying p2p capabilities could potentially be adapted for building a decentralized VPN network. [[github](https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent)]
- [**Micro Transport Protocol**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol) - An open source p2p networking library for building distributed applications and services. It handles peer discovery, communication and reliability, which are core requirements for any p2p network like a decentralized VPN.
- [**PeerJS**](https://peerjs.com/) - PeerJS wraps the browser's WebRTC implementation to provide a complete, configurable, and easy-to-use peer-to-peer connection API. Equipped with nothing but an ID, a peer can create a P2P data or media stream connection to a remote peer. This could be leveraged to create a browser-based decentralized VPN.[[github](https://github.com/peers/peerjs)]
- [**libp2p**](https://libp2p.io/): libp2p is a generic peer-to-peer networking library that can be used to create a variety of applications, including decentralized VPNs. It is written in Go and is available under the Apache 2.0 license.[[github](https://github.com/libp2p)]
- [**WebRTC**](https://webrtc.org/): WebRTC is a peer-to-peer networking technology that is used for real-time communication applications, such as video conferencing and voice chat. It can also be used to create decentralized VPNs. WebRTC is built into most modern browsers and is available under the BSD license. [[github](https://github.com/webrtc)]
